## Courses
* [MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) - this is a course came out in 2018, including self-driving car and deep-learning(DL), can help beginners to lean about applications of deep-learning in the self-driving car field:star::star::star:
* [Apollo Autopilot Introduction](http://bit.baidu.com/product?sort=%5Bobject%20Object%5D) - it is a Chinese course by the Baidu, which is very comprehensive and detailed:star::star::star::star::star:<br>
* [self-driving cars with Carla and Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1F32aVSYaU&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeI12McNQdnTlWz9XlCa0uo) - it's a course came from YouTube in which author uses one of Reinforcement Learning algorithms(DQN) to create a agent which is a self-driving car in the simulator Carla. certainly you can find [it](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1v7411o7wr) as well:star::star::star::star:
* [self-driving cars](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars?skipBrowseRedirect=true) - it's a specialization on the Coursera offered by the University of Toronto, but it isn't in my recommendation list:star:
