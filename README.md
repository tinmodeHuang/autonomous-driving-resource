## Courses
* [MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) - this is a course came out in 2018, including self-driving car and deep-learning(DL), can help beginners to lean about applications of deep-learning in the self-driving car field.<br>
* [Apollo Autopilot Introduction](http://bit.baidu.com/product?sort=%5Bobject%20Object%5D) - it is a Chinese course which is very comprehensive and detailed.<br>
* [self-driving cars with Carla and Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1F32aVSYaU&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeI12McNQdnTlWz9XlCa0uo)it's a course came from YouTube in which author uses a kind of reinforcement-learning(RL) algorithm(DQN) to create a agent which is a self-driving car in the simulator Carla. certainly you can find [it](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1v7411o7wr) as well.<br>
* [self-driving cars](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars?skipBrowseRedirect=true) - with the course learned,  you will: 1) Understand the detailed architecture and components of a self-driving car software stack, 2) Use realistic vehicle physics, complete sensor suite: camera, LIDAR, GPS/INS, wheel odometry, depth map, semantic segmentation, object bounding boxes, 3) Implement methods for static and dynamic object detection, localization and mapping, behaviour and maneuver planning, and vehicle control, 4) Demonstrate skills in CARLA and build programs with Python.
